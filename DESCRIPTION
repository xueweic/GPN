Description: A novel statistical method for multiple phenotype association studies 
    that constructs a bipartite signed network linking phenotypes and genotypes 
    into a unified Genotype and Phenotype Network (GPN). The method effectively 
    handles both quantitative and qualitative traits, with particular strength 
    in analyzing phenotypes with extremely unbalanced case-control ratios. 
    The GPN framework provides enhanced statistical power for detecting 
    associations across multiple correlated phenotypes while controlling 
    for population structure and relatedness.
